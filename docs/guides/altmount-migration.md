# Migrate from Altmount [since 0.9.0](https://github.com/nzbdav/nzbdav/releases/tag/v0.9.0)

The guided migration under **Settings → Altmount Migration** imports an existing Altmount library by rebuilding each release's NZB and submitting it through NzbDAV's normal queue. It does not modify Altmount metadata or store files.

Both legacy raw-protobuf metadata and Altmount v3-prefixed `.meta` formats are supported, including v3 stores. The wizard follows each file's recorded `store_ref`; **Altmount Store Root** can remap its `.nzbs/...` suffix when the library was copied from another host or mounted at a different container path.

WARNING: "Back up and keep Altmount data available"


    Back up both applications before beginning. Mount the Altmount metadata, config, and store paths read-only when possible, and keep the old service available until migrated releases play correctly from NzbDAV. The optional symlink step needs write access to the media library and a writable backup directory.

## Before you start
Note: Altmount does NOT have to be running, but can be, for this process to run.
- Configure and test the Usenet providers NzbDAV will use.
- Create the destination NzbDAV categories expected by Radarr and Sonarr.
- Mount the Altmount paths into the NzbDAV container. Values entered in the wizard are **container paths**, not host paths.
- Locate the metadata tree containing `.meta` files and the store tree containing `.nzbs/*.nzbz` files.
- Keep Altmount's `config.yaml` available if you want its SABnzbd category list discovered automatically.

## Run the wizard

1. **Connect** — enter the metadata root. Add `config.yaml` when available and the store root when recorded store paths are not directly readable. Keep **Submit Workers** at `1` unless you have a specific reason to increase it; **Max Queue Depth** limits how many imports NzbDAV queues at once.
2. **Categories** — map every discovered Altmount category to an existing NzbDAV category, or exclude it.
3. **Scan** — NzbDAV groups metadata by store, verifies the referenced `.nzbz` data, estimates fetch cost, and checks whether the release is already present.
4. **Review** — inspect red/amber findings, exclusions, filename changes, and collisions. Blocking collisions must be resolved before the run can start.
5. **Run** — the wizard reconstructs NZBs and submits them through NzbDAV's normal import pipeline. Progress survives restarts. Pause or cancel stops before the next submission; an individual submission already crossing the queue boundary is allowed to finish and is recorded safely.
6. **Links (optional)** — build a dry-run plan for library symlinks that still target Altmount. Review every status before applying. NzbDAV writes a restore archive first, changes symlinks only, and leaves real files, unmatched links, and drifted links untouched.

The wizard can be reset after work reaches a non-active state. Resetting clears the current scan and plan but retains completed migration mappings so later symlink scans can identify releases imported in earlier runs.

## Symlink safety and restore

Set **Library Root** to the media library containing the links and **Backup Directory** to a separate writable location. Apply and restore are confined to the Library Root and reject symlinked or reparse-point parent directories. If a link target changes after planning, the drift guard leaves it untouched.

Use **Restore previous rewrite** to select a generated archive. Restore verifies that each link still points to the replacement recorded by that archive before restoring its original target.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| No categories discovered | Supply Altmount's `config.yaml`, or continue to Scan so categories can be discovered from stores. |
| `store_missing` | Mount the `.nzbs` tree and set **Altmount Store Root** to the directory that contains `.nzbs`. |
| A release is already migrated | It is not resubmitted; retained provenance can still be used for symlink matching. |
| Start migration is disabled | Resolve blocking collisions, map or exclude every category, and successfully refresh the review tables. |
| Reset is disabled | Cancel active work and wait for the session to reach a non-active state. A paused run is still active. |
| A symlink is `orphan` or `failed` | Review its match/target details. The wizard will not guess or overwrite a link that cannot be verified safely. |
